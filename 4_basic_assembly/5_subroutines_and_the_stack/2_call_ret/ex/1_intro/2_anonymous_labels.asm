; Anonymous labels
; @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
;
; We introduce the syntax of anonymous labels in fasm.
; Anonymous labels have the form:
;
; @@:
;
; You can have as many anonymous labels as you want in your source file.
; You can refer to the next anonymous label as @f (f stands for Forward), and
; to the previous anonymous label as @b (b stands for backwards). @r is a
; synonym for @b.
;
; Example:
;
; @@:
;   jmp   @b  ; Jump to the first anonymous label.
;   jmp   @f  ; Jump to the second anonymous label.
; @@:
;
;
; Note that this syntax should only be used if the code is very simple and
; clear. Excessive use of anonymous labels can make your code unreadable.
; Prefer Local labels with meaningful names over Anonymous labels.
; 
; This material is introduced mainly because you might see those labels in other
; people's code.

; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    Try to give the program different inputs, and observe the output.
;
; 2.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;           Sums i in range (1, n) and if the sum equals 0xA, print 
;           'The sum is a!', else print 'The sum is not a...'
;
; 3.    Note the use of anonymous labels in the code.
;
; 4.    Explain the program's output.
