; 1.    What are the numbers found by the program? Try to guess.

; 2.    Read the code below, and try to understand the meaning of the numbers
;       returned by the program.

; 3.    Why does it take the program so long to complete? How many iterations
;       does the main loop goes through?
;       The program will take 2^32 iterations to find a match because it will start with
;       0xffffffff and decrement by 1 until 0 then print and exit
