;       The bss section is used for declaring uninitialized areas of memory for use during run time.

start:
    
    ; Read coordinates of the first vector:
    call    read_hex
    mov     dword [v1.x],eax
    call    read_hex
    mov     dword [v1.y],eax

    ; Read coordinates of the second vector:
    call    read_hex
    mov     dword [v2.x],eax
    call    read_hex
    mov     dword [v2.y],eax

    ; Add the two vectors:

    ; Copy first input vector:
    ; Note that we have to use an intermediate register, 
    ; as we can not directly mov memory to memory.
    mov     eax,dword [v1.x]
    mov     dword [rvec.x],eax
    mov     eax,dword [v1.y]
    mov     dword [rvec.y],eax

    ; Add second input vector:
    mov     eax,dword [v2.x]
    add     dword [rvec.x],eax
    mov     eax,dword [v2.y]
    add     dword [rvec.y],eax

    ; Print a delimiter: ("========")
    ; NOTE: This is a new subroutine. It can be found inside training.inc.
    call    print_delimiter

    ; Print the resulting vector:
    mov     eax, dword [rvec.x]
    call    print_eax
    mov     eax, dword [rvec.y]
    call    print_eax

    ; Exit the process:
