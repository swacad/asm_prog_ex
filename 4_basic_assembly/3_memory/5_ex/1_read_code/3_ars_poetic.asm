; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;           Prints all byte content from memory location start to end_prog
;
; 2.    Explain the program's output.
;
; 3.    Open the executable in a hex editor, and try to find the output inside
;       the hex data.
;
; 4.    How can you change the program so that it will also apply to the code
;       inside training.inc ?
